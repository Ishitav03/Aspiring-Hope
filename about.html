                <p>
                    <br>There's no place like home. Where else can one walk around freely and not break any rules? A home is the physical embodiment of the people who inhabit it, so it's no wonder that it's such a special place for so many. <br>According to the Homeless World Cup, there were about 1.8 million homeless individuals living in India as of 2019. Over half of this population was living in urban areas, such as slums on the edge of cities. As a result of urbanization, poverty and other factors, people end up on the streets. According to UNICEF, there are high-risk kids who stay with families, but labor on the streets for a living. They end up on the street are often subjected to neglect and physical and emotional abuse at home. Once on the street, children experience trafficking and/or heavy labor as they flee their families in hopes of a new life. Due to severe weather, seven homeless people die every day in Delhi. Homeless people have very little access to healthcare services.
